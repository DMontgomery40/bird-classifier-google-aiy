# Google AIY Birds Classifier for Scrypted

This repository provides a bird species classifier configuration for [Scrypted](https://github.com/koush/scrypted) that uses Google's AIY Birds V1 model.

## Features

- Identifies **964 different bird species**
- Uses Google's hosted TensorFlow Lite model
- No download required - Scrypted fetches the model directly from Google's servers
- Lightweight and efficient for real-time classification

## Usage

In your Scrypted installation:

1. Navigate to the detector plugin settings
2. Enter this repository URL: `https://github.com/DMontgomery40/bird-classifier-google-aiy`
3. Scrypted will automatically download the model and labels
4. Alternatively, you can point Scrypted directly to the raw configuration file:
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DMontgomery40/bird-classifier-google-aiy/main/config.json`

## Model Details

- **Model**: Google AIY Vision Classifier Birds V1
- **Input Size**: 224x224 pixels
- **Model Type**: TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)
- **Species Count**: 964 bird species (includes many North American species)

## Configuration

The `config.json` file in the root of this repository contains all necessary settings for Scrypted to use this classifier:

```json
{
  "name": "Google AIY Birds Classifier",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "model": {
    "url": "https://storage.googleapis.com/tfhub-lite-models/google/lite-model/aiy/vision/classifier/birds_V1/3.tflite",
    "type": "tflite"
  },
  "labels": {
    "url": "https://www.gstatic.com/aihub/tfhub/labelmaps/aiy_birds_V1_labelmap.csv",
    "type": "csv"
  },
  "input": {
    "width": 224,
    "height": 224,
    "channels": 3,
    "mean": [127.5, 127.5, 127.5],
    "std": [127.5, 127.5, 127.5]
  }
}
```

For models converted to OpenVINO, edit `config_openvino.json` with the URLs to
the `.xml` and `.bin` files generated by the conversion script.

## Alternative for North American Birds Only

If you specifically need a classifier trained only on North American birds, consider using [npatta01/Bird-Classifier](https://github.com/npatta01/Bird-Classifier) which is trained on 400 North American bird species.


## Converting the EfficientNet 400-Species Model to OpenVINO

This repository also includes a helper script, `convert_to_openvino.py`, which
invokes the OpenVINO Model Optimizer. Download the EfficientNet bird classifier
weights from HuggingFace (user `edwinhung`) and run:

```bash
python3 convert_to_openvino.py path/to/model.onnx --output_dir efficientnet_openvino
```

The command produces `efficientnet_openvino/efficientnet_birds_400.xml` and
`.bin` files. Update `config_openvino.json` with the hosted URLs to these files
so Scrypted can load the model directly.
=======
## CoreML for Apple Silicon

To build a CoreML version of this model, run `convert_to_coreml.py`.
This downloads the TFLite model and outputs `aiy_birds.mlmodel`.
Use `config_coreml.json` in Scrypted or host the generated model and update the `model.url` field.
